		<h1 class="dark">concentration: indecisive</h1>
		<p class="dark art-text">My process of making art has always been clouded with indecisiveness, always being unsure about whether what I create is “right” or whether other people find my work appealing. My indecisiveness influences everything from starting to finishing a design. This concentration was an opportunity to reflect on the way I design while exploring how I design in a step by step process. These 12 pieces are a journey through my state of mind as a designer.<br /><br /><i>*description of pieces at bottom of page</i></p>

		<p class="dark art-text">The most complex part of my process is finding an idea because it is riddled with confusion and darkness. Not only does my mind become blank and has an absence of ideas, but any ideas I do get I fear are not original. Watercolor (1) represents the inky, darkness that fills my mind when I begin a project while the frustration I feel at the beginning of my creative process is represented by ripped artwork (2), the literal shredding of my thoughts. Eventually, I find a color scheme through testing colors with the teardrop tool (3,4). But after, my indecisiveness fills my mind with doubt as I begin to add type and illustration to my work (5). With the doubt that clouds my mind, I stick to the one thing that I know: sans serif typefaces (6). When I first started illustrating, I felt that my work looked elementary and having to draw felt foreign (7), but as I continued I created (8) which features vibrant colors that represent the confidence I gained. (9) goes back to my love of sans serif typefaces, specifically Helvetica, and draws on Helvetica’s universality and simplicity. With a new flow of ideas, (10) depicts the multiple versions I make of a project. (11) also represents the abundance and flow of ideas, and (12) marks the end of a process riddled with indecisiveness and replaced with new ideas.<br /><br /><br /></p>
